    "# A Graphical Representation of Energy Generation in the United States\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of electricity produced in the United States, in all energy sectors, show a repeating pattern, similar to that of a periodic function. When graphed, the input (x-axis) of the function is represented with any given and output (y-axis) is represented in amount of energy produced, in terms of megawatts/hour (MWh). This program fetches the raw data, outputs a table of points and draws a graph with the points. Afterwards, using patterns from the data points retrieved, the program determines the appropriate variables for the best-fit sinoidsodal function and graphs it.\n",

    "## Raw Data\n",
    "\n",
    "All data is acquired from the [U.S Energy Administration](\"https://www.eia.gov/opendata/\") using their API. Afterwards, the data is formatted into a data table using the pandas library, where each cell contains the amount of energy generated every month from 2001 to 2016. From there, the an x and y values are created in the form of lists and are graphed, along with necessary information (labels, etc.) using the matplotlib library."
